#### Middleware Parameters and use

> [!NOTE]  
> This is ONLY for `middleWare` and does NOT apply to `postWare` functions.
> It does not matter what `postWare` functions return as ic4d does not use that value at all.

Middleware is to define your own custom functions you want to run when a command is run by anyone. This can be a function to check for cooldown or function to add XP to a user.

Middleware that the package already contains is :

-   Check to see if developer command
-   Check to see if bot has sufficient permissions
-   Check to see if user has sufficient permissions

The Middleware **must** take in these parameters

-   `commandObject`: This is the commandObject that every command contains, this can check for the commands name, description, options, choices or a custom property you wish
-   `interaction`**(optional)**: If the middleware function requires you to take in interaction for some reason, here you go ðŸ˜ƒ

And should always return 1 or another number. If it returns 1 it counts as a fail so the function won't proceed. Another number returned is okay seen as a pass and the function continues.
(If you don't understand, if a normal user tries to run a dev command, it will return 1, which means it wont run and their met with a fail message)

##### Example

Here i define a command with the custom property `canBeServerDisabled`

```js
const {SlashCommandManager} = require("ic4d");
const {SlashCommandBuilder} = require("discord.js");

const rob = new SlashCommandManager({
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName("rob")
        .setDescription("Rob users")
    execute: (interaction, client) => {
        interaction.reply("bang bang!");
    },
});

rob.canBeServerDisabled = true;

module.exports = rob
```

And in my middleware function i check if the command has been server disabled, if the property is enabled.

```js
const isServerDisabled = (name) => {
    // check to see if the function has been disabled by the server, if so return true, otherwise false.
};

const middleWare = (commandObject, interaction) => {
    // you can name the parameters whatever you want, ass long as you remember which one is which.
    if (
        commandObject.canBeServerDisabled &&
        isServerDisabled(commandObject.name)
    ) {
        interaction.reply({
            content: "This command is server disabled",
            ephemeral: true,
        });
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
};

handler.handleCommands([middleWare]); // pass the function alone without brackets or its parameters, i'll do that magic
```

}
function lucky(interaction) {
    // randdom one
    return 1 == 1 ? 1 : 0; // will always return 1.

Commands or functionalities restricted to developers will be accessible to users with IDs in this array.

### **_onlyDev: string_**

```
Default value: "Only developers are allowed to run this command."
```

The message shown when a command restricted to developers is executed by a non-developer.

### **_userNoPerms: string_**

```
Default value: "Not enough permissions."
```

The message displayed when a user lacks the necessary permissions to execute a command.

### **_botNoPerms: string_**

```
Default value: "I don't have enough permissions."
```

The message displayed when the bot lacks the necessary permissions to execute a command.

## Exmaple Use

```ts
const obj: RunFlags = {
    testGuildId: "808701451399725116",
    devs: ["671549251024584725"],

    onlyDev: "Text to display when a user runs a developer command.",
    userNoPerms: "Text to display when the user has insufficient permissions",
    botNoPerms: "Text to display when the bot has insufficient permissions",
};
```

# HandlerFlags

An interface that represents anything you can do with the commands when they are run, BUT before YOUR code executes.

## Properties

### **_debugger: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Enable debugger mode. Prints(almost) everything that happens behind the scenes of course not with the API itself.

### **_disableLogs: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Disabling Logging of the Command Loader. Not advisable but hey it's your bot.

### **_production: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Whether or not this is the production version of the bot. If set to true, commands labelled `isDev` will NOT be loaded. (Use the `setDev()` method in [SlashCommandManager](#slashcommandmanager))

### **_refreshApplicationCommands: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Clears ALL application commands on startup. (Slash commands, User commands, and Message commands.)

### **_logToFolder: string | false_**

```
Default value: (CoreHandler value) or false
```

When debugger mode is enabled, Either log to console or a file.

## Example Use

```ts
const obj: LoaderOptions = {
    debugger: true,
    production: true,
    disableLogs: true,
};
```

# InteractionHandlerFlags

An interface that represents anything you can do with the interactions when they are run, BUT before YOUR code executes.

## Properties

### **_debugger: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Enable Debugger mode. Prints (almost) everything that happens behind the scenes of course not with the API itself.

### **_disableLogs: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Disabling Logging of the Context Menu Loader. Not advised but hey it's your bot. Default is false.

### **_refreshContextMenus: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Clears Context Menus

### **_logToFolder: string | false_**

```
Default value: (CoreHandler value) or false
```

When debugger mode is enabled, Either log to console or a file.

# LoaderOptions

Interface that represents default string values for the loader to log to the console when it encounters a command/context menu.

Make sure you keep `NAME` in the string or else you will not know what happened to which command.
If there is no log in the console for a specific command, then it has been loaded, there are no edits and it has not been deleted.

## Properties

Note:

> These have multiple default values, as context menus and commands are different.

### **_loaded: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that load in

### **_edited: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets edited.

### **_deleted: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets deleted.

### **_skipped: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets skipped. (Deleted and still marked as deleted.)

### **_loadedNoChanges: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets loaded, but has no changes

## Example Use

```ts
const obj: LoaderOptions = {
    loadedNoChanges: "NAME was loaded. No changes were made to NAME.",
    loaded: "NAME has been registered successfully.",
    edited: "NAME has been edited.",
    deleted: "NAME has been deleted.",
    skipped: "NAME was skipped. (Command deleted or set to delete.)",
};
```

# InteractionTypeStrings

Type alias for the strings `"selectMenu"`, `"modal"` and `"button"`

Yes this did not need documenting, but here it is.

# InteractionTypeStringsMap

Here's the exact definition because I genuinely don't know how to explain this.

```ts
export type InteractionTypeStringsMap<U extends string> = U extends "modal"
    ? ModalSubmitInteraction
    : U extends "selectMenu"
    ? AnySelectMenuInteraction
    : U extends "button"
    ? ButtonInteraction
    : never;
```

# Common Problems

## Sharding

This is the exact same code from [Quick Example](#quick-example) except it's sharding compatible

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const { Client, IntentsBitField, ShardingManager } = require("discord.js");
const path = require("path");

const { CommandHandler, ReadyHandler, CoreHandler } = require("ic4d");

const commandsPath = path.join(__dirname, "..", "commands");
const logPath = path.join(__dirname, "..", "logs");

const runFlags = {
    devs: ["671549251024584725"],
    testGuildId: "808701451399725116",
};

// Use ShardingManager to manage shards
const manager = new ShardingManager(__filename, {
    token: process.env.TOKEN,
    totalShards: "auto", // Discord.js will automatically decide shard count
});

manager.on("shardCreate", (shard) => {
    console.log(`Shard ${shard.id} launched.`);
});

// Core bot logic for each shard
if (!process.env.SHARDING_MANAGER) {
    const client = new Client({
        intents: [
            IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds,
            IntentsBitField.Flags.GuildMessages,
        ],
    });

    const core = new CoreHandler(client, logPath);

    const ready = new ReadyHandler(
        core
        async (shardClient) => {
            console.log(`${shardClient.user.tag} is ready!`);
        },
        async () => {
            await handler.registerCommands();
        }
    );

    const handler = new CommandHandler(
        core,
        commandsPath,
        runFlags
    );

    (async () => {
        await client.login(process.env.TOKEN);
        ready.execute();
        await handler.handleCommands();
    })();
}

// Launch all shards
manager.spawn();
```

## Sharing variables between slash and interactions

-   Example: You have where a variable needs to be shared from the slash command callback to the interaction callback. Here there are 3 methods (1 being the recommended approach)

### Method 1 & 2 (Not recommended)

Method 1 involves:

> Setting and retrieving an outside variable which the slash and interaction callback can receive

Method 2 involves:

> Adding a property to the slash command object itself and retrieving that property later in the interaction callback.

```js
// method 1
let variable = "";

const test = new SlashCommandManager({
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName("test")
        .setDescription("Just a test")
        .addStringOption((option) =>
            option
                .setName("string")
                .setDescription("some input")
                .setRequired(true)
        ),

    async execute(interaction, client) {
        try {
            await interaction.deferReply();
            const itemName = interaction.options.get("string").value;

            // method 1 (global variable)
            variable = itemName;

            // method 2 (adding a property)
            test.variable = itemName;

            await interaction.editReply({
                content: "Huh?",
                components: [
                    new ActionRowBuilder().addComponents(
                        new ButtonBuilder()
                            .setCustomId("hello")
                            .setLabel("click now")
                            .setStyle(ButtonStyle.Primary)
                    ),
                ],
            });
        } catch (e) {
            errorHandler(e, client, interaction, EmbedBuilder);
        }
    },
}).addInteractions(button);

const button = new InteractionBuilder()
    .setType("button")
    .setCustomId("hello")

    .setCallback(async (i, c) => {
        // method 1
        const itemName = variable;

        //method 2
        const itemName = test.variable;
        await i.update({ content: itemName, components: [] });
    });

module.exports = test;
```

Method 1 issue:

> **Concurrency issues:** The main problem with this method is that if multiple users run the command simultaneously, the variable is overwritten by the most recent execution. This means that data intended for one user could be exposed or altered by another userâ€™s command, leading to unexpected behavior and security issues.

Method 2 issue(s):

> **Shared State:** Although this method keeps the variable associated with the specific command object, it still doesn't address the issue of multiple users running the command. If two users execute the command, the stored value will change to reflect the most recent one, causing similar issues to the global variable method.
>
> **Not Scoped Per Interaction:** This approach doesnâ€™t effectively isolate variables for individual interactions, which can lead to data being inadvertently shared between users.

### addInteractionVariables() (method 3)

This uses a new function passed into [SlashCommandManager execute function (in the constructor object)](#constructor-3), which you can use to pass anything to the interactions associated with this command.
(Returns void);

-   `k`**: { [key: string]: any }**
    -   Object of variables to save and be referenced later in interactions associated with this command.

Then to use these variables, in either the [setCallback](#setcallback) or [setTimeout](#settimeout) method of the [InteractionBuilder](#interactionbuilder), add the optional parameter `variables` which returns the object you passed (hopefully)

Example:

```js
const test = new SlashCommandManager({
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName("test")
        .setDescription("Just a test")
        .addStringOption((option) =>
            option
                .setName("string")
                .setDescription("some input")
                .setRequired(true)
        ),
    // here we add the function in the parameter list
    async execute(interaction, client, addInteractionVariables) {
        try {
            await interaction.deferReply();
            const itemName = interaction.options.get("string").value;
            await interaction.editReply({
                content: "Huh?",
                components: [
                    new ActionRowBuilder().addComponents(
                        new ButtonBuilder()
                            .setCustomId("hello")
                            .setLabel("click now")
                            .setStyle(ButtonStyle.Primary)
                    ),
                ],
            });

            // using the function
            addInteractionVariables({ itemName });
        } catch (e) {
            errorHandler(e, client, interaction, EmbedBuilder);
        }
    },
}).addInteractions(button);

const button = new InteractionBuilder()
    .setType("button")
    .setCustomId("hello")

    // add the variables to the parameter list
    .setCallback(async (i, c, variables) => {
        // using the variable in the callback
        await i.update({ content: variables.itemName, components: [] });
    });
```

This method will always find the variables associated with the message sent by the bot. (This method may not work if you have something like a modal before a bot response as it uses the messageId as a unique identifier.)

> **(Better explanation)** `addInteractionVariables()` function ties variables to unique message Ids AND the custom IDs of the slash command, ensuring that data remains scoped to specific interactions and is not shared or overwritten between users. This approach enhances data safety by preventing concurrency issues and ensuring only the relevant interaction can access its data. It also sorta simplifies the process of passing data between commands and interactions

If any of the approaches don't help your use case. It's always best to just use [Message collectors](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/collectors)

## CommandHandler Reading the wrong files

-   Example: This function is in the `commands` direcotory as it is used by multiple commands, but is not a commands itself.

    ```js
    const function a(userBalance) {
        return userBalance > 0 ? true : false;
    }

    module.exports = a;
    ```

    -   The Command Reader will try to read it but error as it is not a command it can read, to avoid this, make sure you export the `isCommand` (Set to false) property with the function.

    ```js
    const function a(userBalance) {
        return userBalance > 0 ? true : false;
    }

    module.exports = {a, isCommand = false};
    ```

    -   Usually, the reader should skip over anything it can't read, but if needed, this will immediately make it skip.

# Credits

Huge credit to [underctrl](https://github.com/notunderctrl), Code would've not been possible if i did not watch his helpful discord.js tutorials! I had to give him credit because this package is based off moving all those files fromm his tutorial into one package.

He probably has a way better package, so go check his out!
